# Lab sessions COM4509/6509 Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence - University of Sheffield

## Autumn 2020 by Mauricio A Álvarez (1-5) and Haiping Lu (6-10)

## Accessing the Lab Notebooks

We will use Jupyter Notebooks running a Python 3+ kernel for the Lab Sessions.

You can access the environment required in different ways.

### Option 1.

You can [install Anaconda in your local computer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and then [launch Jupyter Notebook using the Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/). The Anaconda distribution contains all the Python libraries that we will use in this module (e.g. Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pytorch, etc).

If you are a Linux or MacOS user, you can open a Jupyter Notebook by 
typing on your terminal

`jupyter notebook Lab 1 - Probability and Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks.ipynb`


### Option 2. 

The [University of Sheffield has a remote desktop service](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/remote/remote-desktop) that you can use. The remote desktops have Anaconda already installed. Once you connect to the remote desktop, use the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) to open a Jupyter Notebook. If you connect to a Linux computer, you can open Jupyter Notebook using the terminal as explained in Option 1.

### Option 3
